    <h1>Re: Eileen Dover university application</h1>

    <p>Dear Eileen,</p>

    <p>Thank you for your recent application to join us at the University of Awesome's science faculty to study as part<br>
        of your PhD next year. I will answer your questions one by one, in the following sections.</p>

    <h3>Starting dates</h3>

    <p>We are happy to accommodate you starting your study with us at any time, however it would suit us better if you<br>could start at the beginning of a semester; the start dates for each one are as follows:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>First semester: 9 September 2016</li>
        <li>Second semester: 15 January 2017</li>
        <li>Third semester: 2 May 2017</li>
    </ul>



Please let me know if this is ok, and if so which start date you would prefer.

You can find more information about <a href="http://example.com">important university dates</a> on our website.


    <h3>Subjects of study</h3>

At the Awesome Science Faculty, we have a pretty open-minded research facility — as long as the subjects fall somewhere in the<br>realm of science and technology. You seem like an intelligent, dedicated researcher, and just the kind of person we'd like to have on our team.<br>Saying that, of the ideas you submitted we were most intrigued by are as follows, in order of priority:

<ol>
    <li>Turning H2O into wine, and the health benefits of Resveratrol (C14H12O3.)
    </li>
    <li>Measuring the effect on performance of funk bassplayers at temperatures exceeding 30°C (86°F), when the audience size exponentially<br>increases (effect of 3 × 103 increasing to 3 × 104.)
    </li>
    <li>HTML and CSS constructs for representing musical scores.
    </li>
</ol>

<p>So please can you provide more information on each of these subjects, including how long you'd expect the research to<br> take, required staff and other resources, and anything else you think we'd need to know? Thanks.</p>


    <h3>Exotic dance moves</h3>

Yes, you are right! As part of my post-doctorate work, I did study exotic tribal dances. To answer your question, my favourite dances<br>are as follows, with definitions:

<dl> 
<p><dt>Polynesian chicken dance</dt></p>

    <dd>A little known but very influential dance dating back as far as 300BC, a whole village would dance around in a circle<br>like chickens, to encourage their livestock to be "fruitful". </dd>
    
<p><dt>Icelandic brownian shuffle</dt></p>

    <dd>Before the Icelanders developed fire as a means of getting warm, they used to practice this dance, which involved huddling<br>close together in a circle on the floor, and shuffling their bodies around in imperceptibly tiny, very rapid movements.<br>One of my fellow students used to say that he thought this dance inspired modern styles such as Twerking.</dd>
    
<p><dt>Arctic robot dance</dt></p>

    <dd>An interesting example of historic misinformation, English explorers in the 1960s believed to have discovered a new dance<br>style characterized by "robotic", stilted movements, being practiced by inhabitants of Northern Alaska and Canada.<br> Later on however it was discovered that they were just moving like this because they were really cold.</dd>
</dl>

<p>Yours sincerely,</p>
<p>Dr Eleanor Gaye</p>
